ldapscripts package shipped in Debian is slightly modified to work out of the
box. If you have libnss-ldap installed and configured, ldapscripts will use
configuration from libnss-ldap.conf. More details could be found in comments
inside /etc/ldapscripts/ldapscripts.conf

If you have any problems with ldapscripts' utilities, first look on
/var/log/ldapscripts.log where all details, warnings and errors goes.
