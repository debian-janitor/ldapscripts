TODO (ideas) :
**************

- Having a kind of plugin management that would allow users to trigger functions
  (to set specific variables or perform preliminary work)
- Improve logfile format
- Make some scripts useable with lower privileges than root :
  - Move ldapid, ldapfinger, ldapsetpasswd, lsldap to bin/ and set them suid
  - Allow common users to use these tools. It will require a kind of privilege separation
    not to bypass OpenLDAP ACLs (binding with user's account id necessary).
  - Ldappasswd without any argument should change the caller's passwd if logname != root
- Check for base (mandatory) binaries at install time (new 'test' target => sed, grep, ...)
  Better testing on configured/additional binaries at run time (e.g. add -f for each -x test)
- Allow to use %g (goup name) in ldapadduser (for _HOMEDIR and _genpassword)
- Merge UIDSTART and MIDSTART or find a way to use them efficiently
  (currently, to avoid id overlapping, once a user or machine is created, the next id will
  be its id + 1, for any kind of account. UIDSTART and MIDSTART are only used for the very
  first account created ; this behaviour should be changed)
- Add more options to the scripts (a better parsing will be necessary)
  - an option to ldapdeleteuser to delete users' home directories
  - a 'dry-run' option to display (only) LDIF data
  - an option to modify the home dirs (LDAP + directory + rights) of a user when renaming it ?
  - an option to modify related groups (memberUid's) when renaming/deleting a user/machine ?
  - an option to block deleting a group if it is a user's primary group ?
