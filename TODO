TODO (ideas) :
**************

- Allow to use %g (goup name) in ldapadduser (for _HOMEDIR and _genpassword)
- Merge UIDSTART and MIDSTART or find a way to use them efficiently
  (currently, to avoid id overlapping, once a user or machine is created, the next id will
   be its id + 1, for any kind of account. UIDSTART and MIDSTART are only used for the very
   first account created ; this behaviour should be changed)

- Add more options to the scripts (a better parsing will be necessary)
  - an option to ldapdeleteuser to delete users' home directories
  - a 'dry-run' option to display (only) LDIF data
  - an option to modify the home dirs (LDAP + directory + rights) of a user when renaming it ?
  - an option to modify related groups (memberUid's) when renaming/deleting a user/machine ?
  - an option to block deleting a group if it is a user's primary group ?
